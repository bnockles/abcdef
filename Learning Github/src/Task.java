TASK A (Worth 80%)
A window appears on screen on which there are two buttons: a Button that says "Lose"
 and a button that says "Win". If the user clicks the Button that says "Lose", 
 text appears that says "You lose." Furthermore, clicking either Button will not
  do anything (You cannot click the "Win" button after clicking the "Lose" Button)
   Alternatively, if the user clicks the "Win" button, the text reads "You win." 
   and both Buttons are disabled.

TASK (Worth 100%)
A window appears on screen on which there is one Button and text that says 
"Score: 0". The Button says "Ready". When the user clicks the Button, a countdown 
appears: "3...2...1... Go!" After the words "Go" appears, the Text on the Button 
says "Click Me!". A clock shows that there are five seconds. During this time, 
(and only during these five seconds) each time the user clicks the button, the Score 
increases by 1. After 5 seconds ends, the text on the Button says "Done". Clicking 
the button does not have any effect. The Score remains visible on the screen.
